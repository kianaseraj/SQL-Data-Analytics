#  Sales Analysis Using SQL

###  Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of a sales dataset using **pure SQL**, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs), customer behavior, product trends, and time-based insights. The goal is to demonstrate the power of structured queries in uncovering business insights and to showcase a wide range of analytical techniques commonly used in real-world dashboards and business reporting.

The analysis includes trend detection, segmentation, ranking, comparative performance, and part-to-whole contributionsâ€”mimicking what professional data analysts do when supporting decision-makers.

###  Dataset Structure

The SQL database includes the following key tables:

- `fact_sales`: Transactional sales data (order date, sales, quantity, product/customer keys)
- `dim_customers`: Customer demographics and details
- `dim_products`: Product metadata (category, subcategory, cost)

Plus, two custom views for reporting:

- `report_products`
- `report_customers`

*Note:* Metadata was explored using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
