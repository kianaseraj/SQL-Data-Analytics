# üìä Sales Analysis Using MySQL

### Overview

This project explores and analyzes a sales dataset using SQL, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs), customer behavior, product trends, and temporal patterns. The aim is to demonstrate the power of structured queries for business insight extraction and to practice a wide range of analytical techniques in SQL.
The analysis touches upon various areas including trend analysis, segmentation, comparative performance, ranking, and part-to-whole contributions ‚Äî mimicking what real-world data analysts do for business dashboards and reporting.

dim_customers: customer demographics and details

dim_products: product metadata including category, subcategory, cost

Views (reports): report_products, report_customers

Metadata accessed via INFORMATION_SCHEMA for structure exploration
